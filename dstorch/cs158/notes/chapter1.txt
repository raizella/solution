Simplest form of information retrieval is called
"grepping"--scanning linearly through a document
for the search term.

p.4 -- the boolean retrieval model as applied
to an incidence matrix

p.5 -- terminology: differentiating between
an "information need" and the "query" that
the user actually passes to the IR system
PRECISION and RECALL
-an incidence matrix is extremely parse,
which is why a linked list representation
of the inverted index is better

p.6 -- an inverted index consists of
a dictionary and postings

p.6 -- an overview of the steps involved
in building an inverted index

p.7 -- assume that each document has a unique
serial number (a docID); we can assign successive
integers to documents as they are encountered during
index construction
-main step in constructing the index is by sorting
a big list of (term, docID) pairs
-have each dictionary entry also record document
frequency
-postings lists are usually either singly linked
lists or variable length arrays

p.8 -- good summary of how the inverted index is
built! 

1.3 Processing Boolean Queries
------------------------------

pp.10-11 -- why keeping the document frequency is
useful for doing a series of logical ANDs

p.12 -- !! possible fast ways for doing a series
of logical conjunctions !!

p.13 -- boolean query model contrasts with now
more popular free text queries, often making
use of ranked retrieval
