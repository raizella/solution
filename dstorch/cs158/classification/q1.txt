The average number of features for feature set 1 is 87.1478 features per 
document. For feature set 2, there is an average of 47.95 features per 
document. In terms of distribution, feature set 1 is nicely distributed, 
with a large number of features appearing in only one document (~1400),
and fewer (by a logarithmic scale) features appearing in more documents.

For feature set 2, the distribution is fairly flat, with many features 
having between 800 and 5000 documents they appear in, but as there are
fewer features in feature set 2, it makes sense that the number of documents
with any specific frequency would be rather low.
